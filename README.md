## Implementation Notes

The idea of this solution was that you can have multiple game pluggable game engines.
There is no container of any kind required for local games, so I've implemented a simple hardcoded PokerEngineFactory and invoking it straight from the PokerHand class.
It uses a singleton pattern to limit a number of instances. In the server side scenario I would implement it inside of a container and will wire all of this through Dependency Injection.
A required flexibility achieved by using pluggable game engines and configurable set of hand valuation rules. 

- All tests are passing, some new tests were added. 
- Due to time constrains some methods not optimized and have more than 30 lines of code. 
- More Javadocs would be also nice.   

## Task
Implement the `int compareTo(PokerHand opponentHand)` method of the `PokerHand` class, such that two poker hands
can be compared. This method should return

- `HandResult.WIN.comparatorValue` if this hand is better than the opponent's hand 
- `HandResult.LOSS.comparatorValue` if the opponent's hand is better 
- `HandResult.TIE.comparatorValue` if the result is a tie (AKA a split pot) 

The hands should be ranked according to the rules of [Texas Hold'em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em).

The `PokerHand` class has a constructor that accepts a string containing 5 cards, e.g.

```java
PokerHand hand = new PokerHand("KS 2H 5C JD TD");
```

The characteristics of the string of cards are:

- Each card consists of two characters, where
  - The first character is the value of the card: `2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T(en), J(ack), Q(ueen), K(ing), A(ce)`
  - The second character represents the suit: `S(pades), H(earts), D(iamonds), C(lubs)`
- A space is used as a separator between cards

In this poker game, Aces are always the highest card in the deck (14), so `"AS KH QC JD TD"` _is_ a straight, but 
`"AS 2H 3C 4D 5D"` _is not_.

### Tests
The repository includes a suite of unit tests that can be used to verify the correctness of your solution. It's 
not feasible to write a test for every possible combination of poker hands, but you are welcome to add additional test
cases to the suite (but please don't remove or modify any of those provided). 

The tests can be run by executing `./gradlew test` (Mac/Linux) or `gradlew.bat test` (Windows) on the command-line 
from the project's root directory.

## Guidelines
The game can be implemented using any combination of the following languages: 
- Java 
- JavaScript
- Kotlin
- Groovy 

You are welcome to add any 3rd party libraries/frameworks. If you choose Kotlin or Groovy, you'll need to modify the 
build file to support compilation of these languages. It is recommended you use at least JDK version 8.

If you choose JavaScript, you'll need to re-implement the skeleton code and tests in this repository. You will 
also need to include clear instructions for how to build/run the tests e.g. 
> execute `npm install` followed by `npm run test` in the project root

The goal is to pass the test suite. If there isn't a test for a particular case, e.g. an invalid string being passed to the `PokerHand` constructor, you may ignore it.

### GitHub
- Clone or download this repo (do not fork it)
- Push your solution to a private GitHub repo in your account
- When your solution is complete, add your ClarusONE contact as a collaborator to this repo, so we can access 

## Evaluation
While we would ideally like to receive a complete solution i.e. a solution which passes all of the included test cases, 
we're more interested in the quality of the solution than completeness. In other words, a high quality solution that 
omits a few edge cases will receive more credit than a complete, but low-quality solution.

One measure of the quality of a solution is it's flexibility, e.g. if the rules were changed such that two pairs beats three-of-a-kind, how easy is it to make this change?
